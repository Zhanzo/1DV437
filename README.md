# 1DV437
This is the game that I made for the course 1DV437 at Linnaeus University.
The game is a 3D space shooter made in Unity3D.

## Player
The player controls a spaceship which can collect coins and shoot missiles.

## Coins
The coins give the player points and the highscore is saved.

## Enemies and obstacles
The game contains asteroids which must be destroyed or dodged.
The game also contains turrets which will fire missiles against the player. These can be dodged or destroyed.
The game also contains enemy spaceships which will move toward the player and fire missiles. These spaceships must be destroyed.
If the player collides with an asteroid or an enemy the player will be destroyed and the game will be over.
